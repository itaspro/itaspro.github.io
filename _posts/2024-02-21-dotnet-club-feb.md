This is just another collaboration with Pie & AI, and we are excited to announce the February event of our club.

The AI wave continues to impact friends across all industries. You must be wondering, aside from using ready-made tools like ChatGPT, if there's a way to incorporate the latest AI technologies into your own projects/products, just like Microsoft's Copilot. We will guide you through a series of hands-on courses to get familiar Semantic Kernel and quickly keep pace with the tides.

Compared to our previous class in November, this time we upgrade the course with brand new online experiment platform, and we believe you will find it simple and easy to get started with the new technology.

For details on the February 27th event, please refer to the poster in this post.

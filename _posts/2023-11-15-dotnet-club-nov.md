After a summer break, our club's activities are setting sail once again.

The AI wave continues to impact friends across all industries. You must be wondering, aside from using ready-made tools like ChatGPT, if there's a way to incorporate the latest AI technologies into your own projects/products, just like Microsoft's Copilot. We will guide you through a series of hands-on courses to get familiar Semantic Kernel and quickly keep pace with the tides.

For details on the November 22nd event, please refer to the poster in this post.

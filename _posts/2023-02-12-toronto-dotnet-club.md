Editor's Note: Since we announced the initiation of offline activities at the end of last year on social media platforms, many of you have messaged us inquiring about the details. First, we would like to express our gratitude for your interest. As you see, right after the New Year holidays we're here with our event announcement. You're welcome to register and join us. Don't miss out on March 2nd! Once again, we wish all our friends prosperity in the Year of 2024 and success in all your endeavors.

.NET is a software development platform launched by Microsoft. Since its release in 2002, it has undergone several major updates. In recent years, it has completed its transformation into an open-source and cross-platform framework, making it a popular technology among developers. Several cities in China, such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Suzhou, have their own .NET clubs. Since 2018, many online and offline technical activities have been organized, receiving widespread acclaim.

In Toronto, there are many engineers working in various enterprises and a considerable amount of students in universities. However, there has long been a lack of platforms for everyone to communicate and share technical knowledge specific to .NET and its ecosystem. The three directors of ITAs are now bringing the ideas of .NET club to Toronto. The Toronto .NET Club is set to be established on March 2, 2023. This developer community centered around the Microsoft .NET platform organizes technical exchanges and innovative exploration activities for software engineers, project managers, operational personnel, university students, and more.

As a key part of the Global AI Bootcamp 2023 international collaboration, the club will also invite several technical experts and community leaders to share the latest technologies and use cases related to .NET, Azure, and AI on the day of March 2nd. The club will continue to introduce other events, presenting technologies and cases in the fields of Microsoft 365, Dynamics, and Power Platform, so stay tuned.

* Date: March 2, 2023, Toronto local time 18:30-21:00
* Location: Microsoft Canada's office at CIBC Square (81 Bay St. 44th floor CIBC Square, Toronto, ON, M5J 0E7)
